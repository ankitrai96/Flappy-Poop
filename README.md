# Flappy Poop Game

*Flappy Bird Spoof with Score Index*

This repository contains the source-code of Flappy Poop, a game based on flappy bird.
I've also incorporated a backend engine based on hypertext preprocessor that indexes scores of players and drafts a leaderboard accordingly.
The game environment is based on p5.js library.
